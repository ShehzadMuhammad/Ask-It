# Question And AnswerSite
A MERN stack site that allows you to create a user, post a question and answer other posts

This is the second MERN Stack (Mongo, React, Express and NodeJs) project that I made after the Zara Mock Site.

I made this to help me with how to post data into the server from the client side and I also became more familiar with Redux

In this web application, You Create a User OR Login if you already have registered and You can view posts and comments or post your own question
